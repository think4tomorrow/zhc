Known as a 'bond reset', a special key combination, that is not related to the user defined key map, which
clears all wireless connection configurations. The keys must be held for 3 to 5 seconds after the device is
reset.

:::warning
Currently, ZMK only supports a single BLE host. If you remove the keyboard from the host's bluetooth devices
list, you will need to clear the bonds.

### Split Keyboards

Split keyboards will need to be cleared on both halves. For best results try to reset them at the same time.
