title: New Keyboard Shield
---

## Overview

This guide will walk through the steps necessary to add ZMK support for a keyboard the uses a (Pro Micro compatible) addon MCU board to provide the microprocessor.
The high level steps are:

- Create a new shield directory.
- Add the base Kconfig files.
- Add the shield overlay file to define the [KSCAN driver]() for detecting key press/release.
- (Optional) Add the mateix transform for mapping KSCAN row/coluk values to sane key positions. This is needed for non-rectangular keyboards, or where the underlying row/column pin arrangement does not map one to one with logical locations on the keyboard.
- Add a default keymap, which users can override in their own configs as needed.

It may be helpful to review the upstream [shields documentation](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/2.3.0/guides/porting/shields.html#shields) to get a proper understanding of the underlying system before continuing.

## New Shield Directory

Shields for Zephyr applications go into the `boards/shields/` directory; since ZMK's Zephyr appliction linves in the `app/` subdirectory of the repository, that means the new shield directory should be:

```bash
mkdir app/boards/shields/<keyboard_name>
```

## Base Kconfig Files

There are two required Kconfig files that need to be created for your new keyboard
shield to get it picked up for ZMK, `Kconfig.shield` and `Kconfig.defconfig`.

### Kconfig.shield

The `Kconfig.shield` file defines any additional Kconfig settings that may be relevant when using this keyboard. For most keyboards, there is just one additional configuration value for the shield itself, e.g.:

```
config SHIELD_MY_BOARD
	def_bool $(shields_list_contains,my_board)
```

This will make sure the new configuration `SHIELD_MY_BOARD` is set to true whenever `my_board` is added as a shield in your build.

### Kconfig.defconfig

The `Kconfig.defconfig` file is where overrides for various configuration settings
that make sense to have different defaults when this shield is used. One main item
that usually has a new default value set here is the `ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME` value,
which controls the display name of the device over USB and BLE.

The updated new default values should always be wrapped inside a conditional on the shield config name defined in the `Kconfig.shield` file. Here's the simplest example file:

```
if SHIELD_MY_BOARD

config ZMK_KEYBOARD_NAME
	default "My Awesome Keyboard"

endif
```

## Shield Overlay

The `<shield_name>.overlay` is the devicetree description of the keyboard shield that is merged with the primary board devicetree description before the build. For ZMK, this file at a minumum should include the [chosen]() node named `zmk,kscan` that refernces a KSCAN driver instance. For a simple 3x3 macropad matrix,
this might look something like:

```
/ {
	chosen {
		zmk,kscan = &kscan0;
	};

	kscan0: kscan_0 {
		compatible = "zmk,kscan-gpio-matrix";
		label = "KSCAN";
        diode-direction = "col2row";

        col-gpios
            = <&pro_micro_d 15 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
            , <&pro_micro_d 14 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
            , <&pro_micro_d 16 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>
            ;

		row-gpios
			= <&pro_micro_a 1 (GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_PULL_UP)>
			, <&pro_micro_a 2 (GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_PULL_UP)>
            , <&pro_micro_a 3 (GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_PULL_UP)>
			;
	};
};
```

## (Optional) Matrix Transform

Internally ZMK translates all row/column events into "key position" events to maintain a consistent model that works no matter what any possible GPIO matrix may look like for a certain keyboard. This is particularly helpful when:

1. To reduce the used pins, an "efficient" number of rows/columns for the GPIO matrix is used, that does _not_ match the physical layout of rows/columns of the actual key switches.
1. For non rectangular keyboards with thumb clusters, non `1u` locations, etc.

A "key position" is the numeric index (zero-based) of a given key, which identifies
the logical key location as percieved by the end user. All _keymap_ mappings actually bind behaviors to _key positions_, not to row/column values.

_Without_ a matrix transform, that intentionally map each key position to the row/column pair that position corresponds to, the default equation to determine that is:

```
($row * NUMBER_OF_COLUMNS) + $column
```

Which effectively amounts to numbering the key positions by traversing each row from top to bottom and assigning numerically incrementing key positions.

Whenever that default key position mapping is insufficient, the `<shield_name>.overlay` file should _also_ include a matrix transform.

Here is an example for the [nice60](https://github.com/Nicell/nice60), which uses an efficient 8x8 GPIO matrix, and uses a transform:

```
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/matrix-transform.h>

/ {
	chosen {
		zmk,kscan = &kscan0;
		zmk,matrix_transform = &default_transform;
	};

	default_transform: keymap_transform_0 {
		compatible = "zmk,matrix-transform";
		columns = <8>;
		rows = <8>;

		>;
	};
```

Some important things to note:

- The `#include <dt-bindings/zmk/matrix-transform.h>` is critical. The `RC` macro is used to generate the interanl storage in the matrix transform, and is actually replaced by a C preprocessor before the final devicetree is compiled into ZMK.
- `RC(row, column)` is placed sequentially to define what row and column values that position corresponds to.
- If you have a keyboard with options for `2u` keys in certain positions, or break away portions, it is a good idea to set the chosen `zmk,matrix_transform` to the default arrangement, and include _other_ possible matrix transform nodes in the devicetree that users can select in their user config by overriding the chosen node.

## Default Keymap

Each keyboard should provide an OOTB default keymap to be used when building the firmware, which can be overriden and customized by user configs. For "shield keyboards", this should be placed in the `app/boards/shields/<shield_name>/keymap/keymap.overlay` file. The keymap is configured as an additional devicetree overlay that includes the following:

- A node with `compatible="zmk,layers"` where each child node is a layer with a `bindings` array that binds each key position to a given behavior (e.g. key press, momentarily layer, etc).
- A node with `compatible="zmk,keymap"` that references the layers with a `layers` phandle-array property.
- A chosen node named `zmk,keymap` that references the defined keymap.

Here is an example simple keymap for the nice60, with only one layer:

```
#include <behaviors.dtsi>
#include <dt-bindings/zmk/keys.h>

/ {
	chosen {
		zmk,keymap = &keymap0;
	};

	keymap0: keymap {
		compatible = "zmk,keymap";
		label ="Default nice!60 Keymap";
		layers = <&default>;
	};

	layers {
		compatible = "zmk,layers";

		default: layer_0 {
			label = "DEFAULT";

		};
	};
};
```

:::note
The two `#include` lines at the top of the keymap are required in order to bring in the default set of behaviors to make them available to bind, and to import a set of defines for the HID keycodes, so keymaps can use parameters like `NUM_2` or `K` instead of the raw keycode numeric values.
:::

### Keymap Behaviors

Further documentation on behaviors and bindings is forthcoming, but a summary of the current behaviors you can bind to key positions is as follows:

- `kp` is the "key press" behavior, and takes a single binding argument of the HID keycode from the 'keyboard/keypad" HID usage table.
- `cp` is the "consumer key press" behavior, and takes a single binding argument of the HID keycode from the "consumer page" HID usage table. This is mostly useful for media keys.
- `mo` is the "momentary layer" behaviour, and takes a single binding argument of the numeric ID of the layer to momentarily enable when that key is held.
- `trans` is the "transparent" behavior, useful to be place in higher layers above `mo` bindings to be sure the key release is handled by the lower layer. No binding arguments are required.
- `mt` is the "mod-tap" behavior, and takes two binding arguments, the modifier to use if held, and the keycode to send if tapped.

## Testing

Once you've fully created the new keyboard shield definition,
you should be able to test with a build command like:

```
west build --pristine -b proton_c -- -DSHIELD=my_board
```

and then flash with:

```
west flash
```
